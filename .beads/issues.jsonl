{"id":"homework-7n7","title":"Centralize typography with semantic CSS classes","description":"Refactor font sizes and weights into centralized semantic utility classes to make typography changes easier to maintain.\n\nPreviously, font size and weight changes required updating classes scattered across 10+ component files. This feature consolidates typography into 13 semantic classes defined in globals.css.\n\nImplementation includes:\n- 13 semantic typography classes (text-title, text-subtitle, text-target, text-cta, etc.)\n- Responsive sizes via CSS media queries (@media min-width: 768px)\n- Removal of redundant font-family declarations\n- Consistency fix: home page title now bold like other page titles\n\nFiles modified: globals.css + 8 game components\nAll changes purely visual - no functional changes.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"francois@wndyr.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T08:51:53.647069+02:00","created_by":"francois","updated_at":"2026-02-05T08:51:57.698264+02:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T08:51:57.698264+02:00","close_reason":"Completed: All 13 semantic typography classes implemented in globals.css and applied across 9 component files.
